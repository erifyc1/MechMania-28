TLDR: From testing, it appears the best strategy (without exploitative ability) is to:
1. Pick Knight
2. Rush center
3. If you can kill someone in one hit, attack that player
4. If no one dies in one hit, attack player with highest no. of points\
5. Buy speed potion when respawning if you have enough gold
6. Use speed potion immediately to help reach mid in 1 less turn

Test 1:
- 2 player archer vs wizard
- Rush center, attack each other when in range
Result: Archer 140 Wizard 160

Test 2:
- 2 knights, 1 archer, 1 wizard
- Rush center, if there is a player you can one shot, attack that player
Result: Knights ended with 267 each, wizard with 125, archer with 100
**IMPORTANT: From testing, it appears that if 2 players kill the same player that turn, the kill point goes to both players

Test 3:
- Knight, 3 wizards
- Same strategy as before
Result: Knight completely demolished the wizards
